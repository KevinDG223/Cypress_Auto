Hi, There 👋

📋 Project Overview

This project is an End-to-End (E2E) automated test built using Cypress, one of the most powerful tools for front-end testing.
It automates the purchase flow of an e-commerce demo site by simulating user interactions such as logging in, adding products to the cart, and completing the checkout process.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a clean, maintainable, and fast automation test implemented in Cypress, showcasing how UI workflows can be validated efficiently with minimal setup and human interaction.

🚀 How It Works

The test script (ecommerceTest.cy.js) performs the following sequence:

1️⃣ Opens the e-commerce demo website.
2️⃣ Logs in using valid credentials.
3️⃣ Navigates through product categories.
4️⃣ Selects and adds two products (T-shirt and Jeans) to the shopping cart.
5️⃣ Proceeds to checkout and fills in payment details.
6️⃣ Confirms the order and validates the success flow.
7️⃣ Logs out after completion.
